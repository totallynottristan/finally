<center><h2>Introduction to Kumquats</h2></center>
<p>The term <i>kumquat</i> comes from the Cantonese
(Chinese) word "kam" (gold) and kwat "orange".</p>

<p>Kumquat actually refers to any of several small citrus fruits from trees and
bushes belonging to the rue family of the genus <i>Fortunella</i>.</p>

<p>Kumquats, as the name implies, are golden orange colored fruits with a
spongy rind and juicy pulp. Unlike the common orange, however,
kumquat rinds are sweet and the pulp is quite acidic. Hence, kumquats
are rarely served as fresh table fare, except in the homes of the most
sophisticated gastronomic palates.</p>
